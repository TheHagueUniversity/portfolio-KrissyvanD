               <!-- <div class="study"> <b> The Hague University of Applied Sciences <br> <i>User Experience Design</i></b><br> 2019 - Current</div>    
                --><div class = "description"> <p>My name is Krissy van Deursen. I was born on September 5th 2001 in The Netherlands. I am a User Experience Design student at the Hague University of Applied Sciences. I started this study September 2019. At my study I do all kinds of different things. For example, I design apps and websites for clients but also for myself.
                     While doing this, we see new tools every time, making sure we get to know all of them and choosing our favourite. In addition to that I also learn how to do research before designing for a certain user or client so I know exactly where to focus on. 
                    <br><br>When looking at all the different things we do, I think my main interest lays within the designing part of UX. I love working with Adobe XD to work out templates or designs for apps or websites. I also love looking at certain interfaces and see how it can be made even better than it already is. 
                    My love for aesthetics really comes into play when designing these kind of things. <br><br>Though I still have a lot to learn, I am open to all kinds of new tools and techniques. With every assignment I do, I feel improvement every single time. However, my work isn't perfect yet of course. I am really eager 
                    to learn and curious about all the possibilities laying ahead of me. I can’t wait to develop my skills that are there, or aren’t there yet.
                    </p></div>
                    <div class = "hobby"> <p>In my free time I love to let my creativity out from time to time. I do this in all types of ways, for example painting and drawing, but also making objects out of origami. When I paint I feel like I can express myself however I want. It makes me relax and just forget everything from the outside world. <br><br>I also love designing and redesigning things, 
                        and it doesn't matter what. It could be a room or maybe an app, it doesn't matter. <br><br>I also love getting inspiration from music. Some music just inspires me to make certain art, but it also relaxes me and makes me happy. Music is one of my biggest outlets. </p></div> 
                    <div class = "skills"><p>One of my biggest skills is language. I speak both Dutch and English almost fluently and I speak a little German. <br><br>
                        I am a really curious person. When I use a new tool, I am always eager to figure out how it works so I can learn new skills. I am already quite confident when using Adobe XD. I also worked with processing3 for some of my assignments. Though I like
                        working with digital tools, I also love to use traditional tools. Things such as brushes and acrylic paint are some of my favourites! However, I am always open to learn new things.<br><br>
                        Other skills that I have include communication, collaboration (for example with Hallmark.nl) and analyzing data. I am really excited to develop new skills during my career. My interest is very big when it comes to new tools and techniques that I haven't used yet.
