                <div class = "description"> <p>In my spare time I love to be actively creative. This is mostly done with painting. To make the paintings I use canvas and mostly acrylic paint. However, I love trying out different media to make paintings or art so I can vary my skills a little bit. When needing some inspiration, I always look at my other interests such as movies or music. For example, one of my favorite type of movies are superhero movies.
                    This is why I often paint in a comic book style. It is easy for me because not everything has to be realistic, it can be as superhero like as I want it to be. 
                    <br><br> On other days I do tend to challenge myself by painting something I am not used to, such as this scenery on the right, in the middle. It is not something that I usually paint and I love to try out new things. <br><br>
                    I keep all my paintings, whether I like them or not. If I don't like the paintings, I ask myself what I don't like about them so I can improve even more the next time I try out something similar to the last one. I think it is very important for me to keep this skill going and to better it further in the future, because it might help with designing new things for UXD.
