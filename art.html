                <div class = "description"> <p>We got the opportunity to collaborate with Hallmark.nl for the course Bespoke Design. With this collaboration we were expected to design a gift giving experience that Hallmark could use. To do this we had to work in pairs. Both people of the design team had to interview a user so we could design a personalised digital unwrapping experience. After presenting the finished projects, a few of us were picked to pitch their concept to Hallmark and I am very proud to be able to say that I could pitch mine. <br><br>                  
                With my design partner I created an experience where you can convey your love and message through a creative activity. In our case this creative activity was folding origami. The giver would pick out a format that the receiver would follow to unlock their gift. To unlock your gift you had to use the password and then have to find a hidden object via augmented reality. For this project I made the digital unwrapping part of the prototype. <br><br>
                While making this prototype, I worked with Adobe XD. I chose this tool because I already used it for another app design assignment for my study. Because I already worked with it once, I already knew the basics of Adobe XD. In addition to this, my project partner also knew how to work with this and taught me some new stuff as well, making sure I learned new things and bettered my skills. </p></div>
